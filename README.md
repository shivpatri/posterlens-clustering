Performance evaluation of various clustering algorithms on PosterLens-25 image embeddings

I have created a plotly web app to visualize the performance of clustering algorithms (K-Means, Guassian Mixture and Hierarchical Clustering) on PosterLens-25M data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/aptlin/posterlens-25m

Please feel free to play around with the app:

PS: You can select and de-select the legends on the 3D scatterplot to vizualize individual clusters in the data. I know! it's cool, right!!
